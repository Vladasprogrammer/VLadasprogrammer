## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Iâ€™m an aspiring front-end developer with a background in teaching and working with people of all ages. I started my journey in programming to challenge myself and build things that people can use. Currently, Iâ€™m completing a React.js course at Baltic Technology Institute, where Iâ€™ve been learning how to create interactive and responsive web applications.

## Before diving into programming, I worked as a dance instructor, teaching both casual learners and professional dancers. I also gained experience working in various roles across different countries, including delivery and logistics in Germany and Norway. These experiences taught me adaptability, communication skills, and the ability to quickly learn and solve problems.

## Iâ€™m always eager to improve, and in the near future, I plan to explore PHP for backend development to expand my skill set. I enjoy tackling challenges, learning new technologies, and working on projects that make an impact.

ðŸ“Œ Looking for an internship or junior front-end developer position to apply my skills and grow in a professional environment.
