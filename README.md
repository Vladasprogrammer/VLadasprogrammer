# 👋 Hi, I'm Vlad!  

### 💻 Aspiring Front-End Developer | 🎭 Former Dance Instructor | 🌍 Lifelong Learner  

I’m a passionate **front-end developer** transitioning from a background in **teaching and working with people of all ages**. My journey into programming started as a challenge, but it quickly turned into a passion for **building interactive and user-friendly web experiences**.  

Currently, I’m deep into **React.js** at [Baltic Technology Institute](https://bit.lt/), learning how to craft **responsive and dynamic web applications**.

## 🛤️ My Journey  
- 💃 **From Dance to Code** – Before diving into web development, I worked as a **dance instructor**, guiding both casual learners and competitive dancers. Teaching taught me **patience, adaptability, and how to break down complex concepts**—all of which translate well into programming.  
- 🚚 **Worked Across Europe** – My experience in **Germany and Norway** in delivery and logistics strengthened my **problem-solving, time management, and communication skills**.  
- 🔧 **Expanding My Tech Stack** – In addition to front-end development, I’m planning to explore **PHP for backend development** to become a more well-rounded developer.
